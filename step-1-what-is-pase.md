# What Is PASE? {#what-is-pase}

PASE is sometimes referred to as "the other side" of IBM i. It can seem like a vague cloud of discomfort whenever we have to venture into it. The only way to alleviate discomfort is to take some medicine; and the prescription we have to offer you is knowledge.

By the end of this tutorial we hope you’ve gained a lot more knowledge about PASE and how it works; but even more so, how it can help your business succeed.

The [IBM i Knowledge Center](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/) has this to say about [PASE](https://kti.news/pase-v73):

> PASE for i enables you to run many of your AIX® applications on the IBM® i operating system with little or no change, and effectively expands your platform solution portfolio.

They should end that sentence with an exclamation point to convey the incredible amount of possibilities this opens for IBM i. Some quick things that can be attributed to PASE \(listed in alphabetical order\):

## PASE is like AIX is like Linux {#_pase_is_like_aix_is_like_linux}

PASE is more or less AIX running on IBM i and is using IBM i as its kernel. This is why the majority of AIX binaries run in PASE unchanged. AIX has many similarities to Linux. Because of the close affinity AIX has with Linux it means many things birthed in the Linux world can be made to work in PASE on IBM i.+
