`print('Intro To Python on IBM i')`







\*A near duplicate of the 'PASE' and 'IBM i Access' sections of this thread can be found under the PASE Intro on the '@litmis' gitbook page [here](https://www.gitbook.com/book/litmis/pase-intro/details "Link to the original PASE Intro gitbook page. ") and was originally produced by Aaron Bartell. This was used as a direct template for the introductory sections where only minor edits were made.
