\*Near duplicates of the 'PASE' and 'IBM i Access' sections of this thread can be found under the PASE Intro on the '@litmis' gitbook page [here](https://www.gitbook.com/book/litmis/pase-intro/details "Link to the original PASE Intro gitbook page. ") and were originally produced by Aaron Bartell. These were used as direct templates for the introductory sections where only minor edits were made.
